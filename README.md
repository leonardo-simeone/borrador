## Testing

* The first thing I manually tested numerous times was responsiveness utilizing Chrome as the main browser, I made sure that the site adapts well for different screen sizes. I used devtools not only for the developing process but also for the screen size testing. Also different devices were used for the porpuse of testing, such as mobiles and tablets and the [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://leonardo-simeone.github.io/online-gaming-club/index.html) website was used as well to test responsiveness.
* I also tested effectiveness and efficiency in the links available in the website site, I made sure that all links work as intended and that the user can navigate and find information in the site easily.
* I tested compatibility and functionality across different browsers. I used Chrome, Edge and Firefox, and in every single one of them the website works and responds well.
![Edge Firefox Test](/assets/images/readme-images/edge-firefox.png)
* I made sure that in the case that the user fails to input necessary information in the form, a relevant message shows indicating what the missing information is.
* Once the site was deployed, I also asked friends and family to check it out and navigate through it, including filling out the form as they wished. This way I could put it to the test from a third party standpoint.

### Bugs

* The first issue that I solved was a warning from W3C html checker, indicating that a section did not have a heading. I had placed the heading outside of the section, to solve this I included the heading inside of the section.
<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->

![W3C Warning](/assets/images/readme-images/html-checker-warning.jpg)

<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->

* The second issue I found while testing with the lighthouse tool was that the performance indicator was too low.
<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->

![Low Performance Metrics](/assets/images/readme-images/lighthouse-test-one-done.jpg)

<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
When I researched in [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/improve-largest-contentful-paint-lcp-on-your-website-with-ease/) the posible reason behind this occurence, I found out that the images I used were too heavy. I decided to compress the jpg files into smaller jpg files using [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) and then I converted the smaller jpg images into webp files using [cloudconvert.com](https://cloudconvert.com/) which in turn made them even smaller without losing display quality. The performance indicator improved significantly.
<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->

![Better Performance Metrics](/assets/images/readme-images/images-compression-test.png)

* The third issue I encountered was making the iframe responsive. I reasearched about "how to make a video iframe responsive" and I found in [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-video/) a snippet of code which I copied and adapted to my needs to resolve the issue.
<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->

![Responsive iframe](/assets/images/readme-images/video-iframe-aspect-ratio.JPG)

* The fourth issue to resolve, was the need to alert the user that at least one checkbox for each group has to be checked for the form to be submitted. I researched and realized that by using html and css only, this task was not achievable. The use of a jQuery was necessary, so I found [this block of code](https://www.allphptricks.com/submit-form-atleast-one-checkbox-checked/) which I copied and adapted to each one of the checkboxes groups in the form.
<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->

![jQuery](/assets/images/readme-images/jquery.JPG)

* The fifth and last issue I fixed, was the fact that the form submit and reset inputs were not working. I realized after looking for information on Slack, that I had put the three groups of checkboxes plus the First Name, Last Name and Email group in four different form elements. To resolve this issue I changed the form elements for divs and enclosed all groups in the one form.

### Form Data Verification

* In order to make the website more user friendly, I created a thanks page to which the user is brought once the form has been filled out and submitted. From this page the user can wait to be redirected to the home page or navigate to a preffered page manually.
* Based on the fact that this a front-end only type of website, the information is not being processed in any shape or form however, I wanted to test that before the thanks page implementation, the form was working correctly by sending the data to the Code Institute form dump site utilizing the post method.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### HTML, CSS and Accessibility Validators Testing

* I used the [official W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) on all the html files and no errors were found.
![HTML Validator](/assets/images/readme-images/w3org-html-checker-pass.jpg) <p>&nbsp;</p>
* I ran the css file through the [official W3C Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) and no issues were found.
![CSS Validator](/assets/images/readme-images/jigsaw-css-checker-pass.jpg)
* I used the lighthouse tool in devtools to test color contrast and accesibility and it was marked 100%. <p>&nbsp;</p>
![Lighthouse Test](/assets/images/readme-images/lighthouse-test.jpg)

## Deployment

* I deployed the website using GitHub pages. The steps to do so, were the following:
    * In the GitHub repository project menu, click on the cog wheel marked as Settings.
    * Once in settings, on the left hand side of the screen click on the Pages tab.
    * In the Pages tab select "Deploy from a branch" in the drop down menu from "Source".
    * Right under the Source dropdown menu there is the "Branch" menu, from it select "Main" and "/(root)".
    * Click on save and refresh the page after a few minutes to give GitHub time to process the deployment.
    * At the top you will see the generated link to "Visit site" already deployed.

    ![Deplyment](/assets/images/readme-images/deployment.png)
    * The link to visit the deployed website: [Online Gaming Club](https://leonardo-simeone.github.io/online-gaming-club/index.html)


## Wireframing

To wireframe the website I used [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/wireframes).

## Fonts and Colors Selection
* __Fonts.__

    * Since the google fonts page feature for fonts pairing suggestions was discontinued, I used an alternative tool available to select the fonts for the site.
    * I browsed [heyreliable](https://heyreliable.com/ultimate-google-font-pairings/) google fonts pairings available in their collection and selected number 31 based on the look and mood wanted for the website.
    <!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->

    ![Fonts](/assets/images/readme-images/font-selection.JPG)

    * These two fonts are clear to read and also have a friendly yet professional style which is compatible with a website related to video gaming.

* __Colors.__

    * To select the colors, I used the [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) website which provides the option to input any color you want and then it will provide a selection of matching/compatible colors that relate well to that "base" color you selected in the first place.
    * Once I had my base color selected which is [#222219](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23222219&sub=1), I used ColorSpace and it gave me a wide variety of compatible colors to work with from which I chose several of them and referenced them accordingly in the css style sheet.

## Credits

__Content__

* The knowledge applied in the use of flexbox, I learned from [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox). By using flexbox I was able to position elements in my layout a lot easier than with float.
* The original code to make the video iframe responsive, I took from [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-video/) which I modified later to meet my needs.
* The original code to make at least one checkbox in each group required, I took from [allphptricks.com](https://www.allphptricks.com/submit-form-atleast-one-checkbox-checked/) which I also modified to meet my needs.
* The icons I used in the footer and the headings, I took from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?q=game&o=r&m=free)
* The inspiration for the First Name, Last Name and Email inputs of the form, as well as the overlay on the hero image, I took from the [Love Running](https://leonardo-simeone.github.io/love-running/singup.html) project.
